NEXT STEPS:
1. Sign-up page ✅
2. Content for the customers page (fetch all customers) ✅
3. Fix pending/paid styling issues ✅ (removed bg-gray-700, which is set due to dark mode being my default. Might need to fix it differently in the future)
4. Profile page, with ability to edit information
5. Home page should have links to specific revenue and invoices pages ✅ (this would be the customers page, and sort of the invoices already. Users can view the invoices individually by searching for it in the invoices page. Customers page shows the aggregated data of ALL the invoices and information related to the individual customer. Maybe I will add a link on the customer's page that either A. Brings the customer back to the invoices page (with the search query already filled out with the user clicked on, or B. I could list the individual invoices on the customers page as a pop-up/expansion. Not sure which would be more fun, but I'll probably do A.))
